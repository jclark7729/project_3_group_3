# Symptom-Based Disease Prediction Model

## Introduction
The **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction Model** is designed to assist in early disease detection based on symptoms provided by users. By leveraging machine learning, this model predicts potential illnesses and provides insights for further medical evaluation. The goal is to enhance preliminary diagnostics and encourage timely medical consultation.

## How We Picked the Dataset
Selecting an appropriate dataset was crucial for this project. We focused on publicly available datasets containing symptom-disease mappings, ensuring that they were comprehensive and medically validated. The dataset was chosen based on:
- The number of diseases covered.
- The diversity and granularity of symptoms.
- The presence of labeled medical conditions.
- Availability from reputable sources like medical research papers and open datasets.

## Difficulties and Concerns
During development, we faced several challenges:
- **Data Quality Issues**: Some datasets had missing or ambiguous symptom entries.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Certain diseases were overrepresented, leading to biased predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Mapping symptoms to a numerical format while preserving medical relevance was complex.
- **Model Interpretability**: Ensuring that the model’s predictions were explainable and medically reliable.

## Adjustments Based on Feedback
Based on feedback from domain experts and early testing, we made the following adjustments:
- **Refined Feature Selection**: Removed redundant symptoms to prevent overfitting.
- **Enhanced Data Cleaning**: Standardized symptom naming conventions.
- **Model Tuning**: Adjusted hyperparameters to improve accuracy without overfitting.
- **User Interface Enhancements**: Improved usability for non-technical users.

## How and Why We Removed Data
To enhance model performance, we removed:
- **Redundant Symptoms**: Symptoms with excessive overlap were merged or standardized.
- **Rare Diseases with Insufficient Data**: Conditions with very few occurrences led to unreliable predictions.
- **Outliers and Noisy Data**: Data points that significantly deviated from normal symptom patterns were excluded.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Aggregated and cleaned symptom-disease datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, performed one-hot encoding, and standardized inputs.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful symptom groupings and improved interpretability.
4. **Model Training**: Tested various machine learning models to find the most effective.
5. **Evaluation**: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate performance.

## Models Used
We experimented with multiple models to determine the best-performing approach:
- **Decision Trees**: Simple but prone to overfitting.
- **Random Forest**: Provided better generalization and improved accuracy.
- **Naïve Bayes**: Effective for probabilistic reasoning in symptom-based classification.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Worked well for high-dimensional symptom data.
- **Neural Networks**: Used for deeper learning insights but required more data for generalization.

## Results
- Achieved **X% accuracy** on the test dataset.
- The **Random Forest model** performed the best with a precision of **Y%** and recall of **Z%**.
- The model successfully predicted **most common diseases** with high confidence.
- Identified **edge cases where the model struggled**, such as rare diseases with limited training samples.

## Future Enhancements
To improve our model further, we plan to:
- **Expand the dataset**: Incorporate additional medical records and symptom sources.
- **Enhance Interpretability**: Integrate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain model decisions.
- **Implement a Web/App Interface**: Create a user-friendly platform for real-world use.
- **Improve Rare Disease Predictions**: Introduce techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning.
- **Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Allow users to input symptoms in free-text format.
